Wild West Construction specializes in siding installation and replacement services using premium materials and expert techniques that ensure long-lasting performance in Utah's diverse climate conditions.

Your home's siding serves as the primary barrier against weather elements including wind, rain, snow, UV rays, and temperature extremes. Quality siding installation not only protects your home's structure but also significantly impacts energy efficiency, maintenance requirements, and overall property value. We understand the unique challenges that Utah's climate presents and recommend siding solutions that perform exceptionally in our local conditions.

We work with a comprehensive range of siding materials including vinyl, fiber cement (such as HardiePlank), wood, metal, and composite options. Each material offers distinct advantages in terms of durability, maintenance requirements, aesthetic appeal, and cost. Our experienced team helps you select the best siding option based on your home's architecture, your personal preferences, budget considerations, and long-term maintenance expectations.

Proper installation is critical for siding performance and longevity. Our installation process begins with thorough preparation including inspection of existing sheathing, installation of appropriate house wrap and vapor barriers, and repair of any underlying structural issues. We use manufacturer-approved installation techniques and quality fasteners to ensure your siding performs as designed and maintains its warranty coverage.

We pay careful attention to critical details that prevent water infiltration and ensure optimal performance. This includes proper flashing around windows and doors, careful handling of outside corners and trim work, adequate ventilation behind the siding, and proper caulking and sealing. These details make the difference between siding that performs well for decades versus installations that experience premature failure.

Energy efficiency is an important consideration in modern siding installations. We can incorporate insulated siding systems, improved vapor barriers, and proper ventilation techniques that enhance your home's thermal performance and reduce energy costs.`,

Wild West Construction offers comprehensive flooring installation services covering all major flooring types including hardwood, laminate, luxury vinyl, tile, and carpet. Our expert craftsmen ensure precise installation that maximizes your flooring investment and provides lasting satisfaction.

Flooring is one of the most impactful home improvements you can make, affecting both the aesthetic appeal and functional performance of your living spaces. The right flooring choice depends on factors including room usage, moisture exposure, maintenance preferences, comfort requirements, and design goals. Our experienced team helps you navigate these considerations to select flooring that meets your specific needs and lifestyle.

We specialize in the installation of solid hardwood, engineered hardwood, luxury vinyl plank (LVP), luxury vinyl tile (LVT), laminate, ceramic and porcelain tile, natural stone, and high-quality carpet systems.

Proper subfloor preparation is critical for successful flooring installation. We begin every project with thorough subfloor assessment, addressing any issues with levelness, moisture, or structural integrity before installation begins. This attention to foundation details prevents future problems and ensures your flooring performs as expected.

Our installation process follows manufacturer specifications and industry best practices. We use appropriate underlayments, moisture barriers, adhesives, and fastening systems for each specific flooring type. Our craftsmen pay careful attention to details like expansion gaps, transition strips, and pattern alignment that distinguish professional installation from amateur work.

We understand that flooring installation can disrupt your daily routine, which is why we focus on efficient project completion with minimal inconvenience.
